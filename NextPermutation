Find the next permutation

Rearrange a list of numbers to its next lexicographically greater permutation.
If no greater permutation is possible, rearrange the list to its lowest possible order, which is sorted in ascending order.
You're given a list of numbers arr[] of size N.
So, in simple terms, the task is to rearrange a list of numbers to find the next possible order.
If there isn't a greater arrangement possible, then it should just sort the numbers in increasing order.

Example 1:

arr = {1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4}
Output: {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Explaination: The next permutation of the 
given array is {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6}.

Example 2:

arr = {3, 2, 1}
Output: {1, 2, 3}
Explaination: As arr[] is the last 
permutation. So, the next permutation 
is the lowest one.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
